                    We will get started this week by learning about command-line driven updates to your GitHub repository.

                    In prior classes (like CIT 112, 212, 215), you learnt how to use GitHub, by creating a repository, which is basically the same thing as a folder, except through GitHub and on the cloud. You did not really use Git.
                    
                    Git is a version control system - it tracks and coordinates changes in developed code. It was originally designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
                    
                    We will be using Github to upload and host your work. We'll also be using it to track progress on your group project. For this semester, you should use gLinks to an external site.ithub.com to deploy your final project - as GitHub at IU has security issues that block non-IU profiles from accessing the content.
                    
                    This week, You will also start thinking about project groups. After we start leaning about Bootstrap, you will be working in groups to deliver real applications in education that you can create with web design techniques. These projects will be targeted at Middle school students, and based on teacher lesson plans. We will be working with Ms. Erin Neely from Mt Vernon Middle school, and potentially also Carmel High School.

                    Positioning and spacing different elements can be difficult when building your website. How do you make sure an element isn't touching another element ? How do you position elements so they are not cut off by the page, and have enough space so the site looks professional?

This week, we'll be reviewing (from CIT 212 or equivalent) different positioning techniques, with a focus on flexbox.

                        This week we are going to review HTML/CSS. This way, you all will be able to get a quick refresher so we are not spending weeks on remembering basic HTML and CSS content from previous courses or knowledge you may have. Once we finish this out, we'll be able to start diving into deeper CSS concepts starting next week.

                        One new concept we will dive into this week is the concept of advanced CSS selectors. You all understand how to call an element via a class/id or just a general element, but using these advanced techniques will help in managing and maintaining ther developer's code, and also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your styling.

                        This week we are going to review a topic you may have covered in an earlier web design class - Flexbox, hot on the heels of the Marvel assignment. Flexbox is not a new technique, it was proposed in 2008, and added to CSS in 2009, as a draft proposal. It quickly gained momentum, as a technique that helps us space out HTML elements, and create responsive web pages with little or no additional CSS. Use of the Flexbox layout is an important part of a web developer's toolkit.

                            There are many form building applications, like Google Forms and other proprietary form making specializations for different parts of industry. Here, in this section, you will be building forms using HTML and CSS, with a form tag, and form elements. You will only be considering the front end, you will not be sending data to or receiving data from a server.

                                In designing and creating a form as a professional web developer, you would expect,
                                <ol>
                                <li>to be working with a design team in creating the form and identifying the information required</li>
                                <li> to have input from security experts and observe security protocols in collecting data</li>
                                <li>to follow usability and accessibility guidelines</li>
                                <li> to work with your team in providing easy to follow form instructions, and create an ideal form layout for clients</li>
                            </ol>
                                In this section, we will develop a generic form, which is front end only. This means that the information is not sent to a server to be processed. Typically, an online form gets information from the user and sends the information to a server, maybe in a different geographical location. This server processes the form data - which may involve use of a back-end database, and generation of some confirmation or query which is sent back to the user.</p>

                                    This week, we reconsider CSS and find out about pre-processors that make it easier to write CSS. We also introduce a platform, Node.js, which is very commonly used to run JavaScript, outside of a web browser.

                                    About the pre-processors, CSS can be flipped completely upside down. SASS and LESS are languages, termed pre-processors, you compile into a normal CSS stylesheet that makes developing bigger CSS-heavy projects much easier. These languages do everything that CSS does but add some programming functionality to it to make it easier, allow multiple files to organize your CSS code and so many more abilities that will save you time when styling your websites.
                                    
                                    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment - a platform that makes it possible to run JavaScript code without a browser. While that's a helpful feature, the big advantage of using Node.js is an associated tool, npm, node package manager. You can run a .js file with the command 'node yourfile.js'.
                                    
                                    We will use Less though a CDN, and compile SCSS code into CSS using the SASS compiler. For this SASS compiler, you may choose to install SASS through the node package manager. We will introduce SASS this week, but delve into it further during week #9.

                                            Ultimately, the ONLY style rules that the web document understands are in CSS. All pre-processors get compiled to CSS.

                                            This week we spend some time reviewing the features of a CSS pre-processor, but this time with SASS, and more specifically the SCSS flavor of SASS.
                                            
                                            The other pre-processor we introduced was Less, and consideration of a second one shows you ... although the concept of making a technology more versatile, more efficient and effective to use remains constant, there are typically multiple avenues and platforms that support the same concept. There are multiple pre-processors that represent style rules, and are integrated into the look and feel of a web document by compiling the language into CSS.

                                                Sometimes the best approach when building a website may not be to build everything from scratch. Sometimes using a CSS framework to build all or part of a new application, is the better option. 

                                                What is a CSS framework? It is essentially a bunch of pre-built CSS that you can use without re-inventing the wheel. Following the framework's guidelines, you'll need to add HTML elements and class names to build the website rather than actually having to build out all the CSS.
                                                
                                                This can be good or bad depending on the type of application you're building. Good, as in it could be super easy to quickly build out a website, but bad in the sense you have no creative freedom to work within the frameworks space. Modifying the pre-existing classes is additional effort, and because you cannot easily see the intricacies and dependencies of the framework, customizing a particular class or feature may not be straight-forward. The other angle is security - whether the library is a JavaScript one or a CSS rules based resource, your web site may end up using material that has dependencies you do not know about, or security loop holes you do not want to deal with.

                                                We'll be talking about the Bootstrap framework this week - this is one of the most popular (currently) in the industry.

                                                    In week 10, you saw the core component of any Bootstrap layout - the container, and how to use a container to apply a minimal level of styling to your page content.

                                                    Bootstrap incorporates a lot of styling and a lot of JavaScript. In this course we can only introduce some key parts identified as being used in applications, by some of our industry partners. In practice, this same material is likely to have changed by the time you get to use it as an industry professional. You may even be using a different library, although Bootstrap has become so popular and so widely used it is likely that it will still form part of your development stack. 
                                                    
                                                     
                                                    
                                                    Over the past several years, cards have emerged as a structure to use to best present multiple content  areas on the same page - like presenting products for sale. We have created cards in the past using HTML and CSS - this week, we will create Bootstrap cards, and use containers populated with cards to present information. We also see how to apply navigation in Bootstrap, and explore Bootstrap buttons.
                                                    
                                                    You will learn a popular modern strategy to incorporate the cards, in a responsive multi-row, multi-column layout.
                                                    
                                                    Finally, you will build up a cookies page as a deliverable for lab, and homework this week involves use of a Bootstrap container and a terminology container of cards.
